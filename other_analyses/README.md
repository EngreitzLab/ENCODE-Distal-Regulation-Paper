# Additonal analyses

- Code and reference files in the `enhancer_synergy` directory were used to produce the analysis for the section 'Super-additive functions of distal enhancers,' including Fig. 6 and Extended Data Fig. 9
- The functions in `chromatin_categorization.R` were used to define and annotate element-gene pairs with chromatin categories
- `promoter_class_analysis.R` was used to produce the analysis for Note S5, including Fig. S5.1
